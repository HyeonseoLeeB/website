## Interests

My research interests are in macroeconomics and monetary economics, with a focus on monetary policy, macro-finance, and macro labor. I am interested in identifying monetary policy shocks and their effects on economy. I focus particularly on their interplay with the financial cycle. Additionally, I am interested in the effects of labor market conditions on business cycles, growth and inflation. 

## Education
I earned my B.A. in Economics and Psychology from Seoul National University. 

## Experience
I worked as a Junior Economist at the Bank of Korea from 2018 to 2023. I worked in the Research Department, Monetary Policy Department, and Economics Research Institute.
